# UI Components General Guide

This rule provides a general overview of User Interface (UI) components within the 'eleventa' project. For more detailed conventions and structure, please refer to [.cursor/rules/03-ui-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/03-ui-components.mdc).

## Core Philosophy:
- **Reusability:** Components should be designed to be reusable across different parts of the application (e.g., custom widgets in `ui/widgets/`).
- **Composability:** Build complex UIs (views in `ui/views/`, dialogs in `ui/dialogs/`) by composing simpler, focused components and standard Qt widgets.
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns (structure in Python files, styling in QSS `ui/style.qss`, logic interacting with core services).
- **Accessibility:** UI components should be developed with Qt's accessibility (a11y) best practices in mind.

## Key Directories:
- `ui/`: Primary location for all PySide6 UI code.
    - `ui/main_window.py`: Main application window. [@ui/main_window.py](mdc:ui/main_window.py)
    - `ui/views/`: Major application views/screens. [@ui/views/](mdc:ui/views)
    - `ui/dialogs/`: Various dialogs used in the application. [@ui/dialogs/](mdc:ui/dialogs)
    - `ui/widgets/`: Reusable custom widgets. [@ui/widgets/](mdc:ui/widgets)
- `ui/resources/`: For static assets like icons, images (often compiled `.qrc` files). [@ui/resources/](mdc:ui/resources)
- `ui/styles/` & `ui/style.qss`: For QSS stylesheets. [@ui/styles/](mdc:ui/styles), [@ui/style.qss](mdc:ui/style.qss)

## Technology Stack:
- **Frontend Framework/Library:** PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **Styling Approach:** QSS (Qt Style Sheets)

## Getting Help:
- If you are looking for a specific component, try searching in the relevant subdirectories of `ui/` (e.g., `ui/widgets/`, `ui/views/`, `ui/dialogs/`).
- For detailed guidelines on creating or modifying components, see [.cursor/rules/03-ui-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/03-ui-components.mdc).
