# 01 - Project Overview

This rule provides a high-level understanding of the project.

## Key Information:
- **Project Name:** Eleventa POS - Backend
- **Main Goal:** A Python backend for a Point of Sale (POS) system.
- **Target Users:** (Likely businesses/individuals needing a POS system, e.g., retail stores, small shops)
- **Core Technologies:** Python, PySide6/Qt (for UI), Alembic (for DB migrations), SQLite (primary database inferred).
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** (Likely a layered architecture: UI, Core/Domain, Infrastructure)

## Getting Started:
- **Repository Structure:**
    - `main.py`: Main application entry point. [@main.py](mdc:main.py)
    - `core/`: Core domain logic. Contains domain models in `core/models/` and services in `core/services/`.
    - `infrastructure/`: Implementation details for persistence (e.g., `infrastructure/persistence/sqlite/` for SQLite ORM models and repositories) and other external integrations.
    - `ui/`: User interface components, views, and dialogs (using PySide6/Qt).
    - `tests/`: Contains all tests (unit, integration, UI). Test structure mirrors the application structure.
    - `scripts/`: Utility and helper scripts.
    - `alembic/`: Database migration scripts managed by Alembic.
    - `docs/`: Project documentation.
    - `README.md`: Essential setup and project information. [@README.md](mdc:README.md)
- **Setup Instructions:** Refer to [@README.md](mdc:README.md) for detailed setup. `pip install -r requirements.txt` is key.
- **Main Entry Point:** `main.py` [@main.py](mdc:main.py)

## Important Files:
- Configuration: `config.py` [@config.py](mdc:config.py), `app_config.json` [@app_config.json](mdc:app_config.json), `alembic.ini` [@alembic.ini](mdc:alembic.ini)
- Dependencies: `requirements.txt` [@requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt), `requirements-dev.txt` [@requirements-dev.txt](mdc:requirements-dev.txt)
