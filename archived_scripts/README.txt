# Archived Test Scripts

This directory contains archived test scripts that have been replaced by the unified test runner script.

Archive Date: 2025-04-21 13:10:01

These scripts were archived and removed because all functionality has been consolidated into 'run_unified_tests.py',
which provides a more flexible and robust way to run tests for the Eleventa project.

Please use 'run_unified_tests.py' instead of these scripts.

Additional files archived on: 2025-04-21 13:11:59

The following temporary/obsolete files were archived and removed:
create_test.py, create_fixed_test.py, temp_test_cash_drawer_dialogs.py, fix_script.py, test_dialog_fix.py, patch_qt_tests.py, test_improvements.md, test_naming_convention_guide.md

These files are no longer needed since test functionality has been consolidated 
into the unified test runner ('run_unified_tests.py') and documentation has been 
moved to 'TESTING.md'.
